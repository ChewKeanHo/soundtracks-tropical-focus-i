§ FAQ
━━━━━
(1) Can I use this music for my video?
┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄
**BETTER NOT**.

I'm deploying Udio with the "Cyborg Approach" which means I'm still in full control and the A.I. is only augmenting my natural capabilities.

You can use YouTube audio remixing or include it into your YouTube playlist. If there's any problem, don't hesitate to ping me over the community posts!

Otherwise, as of year 2025, the copyright for A.I output content is still very murky in both East and West countries. If you like this music, please head over to Udio (https://www.udio.com/) and create your very own, fully owned soundtrack!

(2) Can you license the music for my project?
┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄
**NOT YET**.

Not until I figure out how deal with "after-the-fact" guarantees or legal workarounds with Udio. Pre-mature licensing can backfire easily.

That's the only reason I locked my musics under my proprietary license for now.

(3) Is this another A.I. Slop?
┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄
**NO**.

Unlike A.I. Slop that fully automate all kinds of A.I. output disregarding audiences' appreciations and flooding the publishers with nonsense contents, I do listen to all my musics, edit, purge, and optimize them until it passed my quality baseline.

Currently, the ratio of successful tracks you're hearing here is like 12/120 retries. Sometimes I got 1/120 retries or wrost: 0/120. Also, I process the lyrics (whenever applicable) on my own.

As disclosed earlier, I only use A.I. with Cyborg approach; not full automation. Human is still in full control.

(4) Why A.I. & Not Directly Invest Into Music Instruments?
┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄
**A.I. IS CHEAPER, LESS RISKY, AND NEW TO EXPLORE**.

I'm a tech guy specialized in semi-automatic technologies. Personally, I love music but asking me to fully throw more than USD100k just to create a few musics in this economy is too much to ask. Moreover, the minimum amount of time and effort required to reach professional level is very unforgiving.

Secondly, I'm a tech guy. Applied A.I. is part of my domain. I don't see a problem using it as a general purpose musical instrument. Besides, I did not restrict any professional musicians not to use A.I. unfairly. It's just personal opinions.

I just see A.I. is the next step forward and I want it to augment me; not resisting it and self-making myself obsolete.
