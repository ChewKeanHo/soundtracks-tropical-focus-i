Given input (source):
|${____input_source}|

Given input (dest):
|${____input_dest}|

Got expect:
|[NOT EMPTY]|

Got output:
|${____output}|

Got return code:
|${____process}|

IMPORTANT NOTE
Due to this function being a hardware specific and reliant operational one,
it is manually tested and reviewed. Hence, the test case is always passed.
